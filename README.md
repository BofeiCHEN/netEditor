## Building
Only dependency is Qt4+ (core) 
```
qmake
make
./neteditor
```

### on Linux
this won't compile on the command line...
* there is some leftover problem with `macx-clang-libc++`
 
It does however qmake, build and more or less work when loaded as QT creator projects with Qt4

## TODO
There is so much to do, i don't know where to start...
* Unit tests (really, all kinds of tests)
* Prebuilt packages (Travis anyone?)
* Define coding style
* ...
